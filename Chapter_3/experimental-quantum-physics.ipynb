    "# Experimental Quantum Physics\n",
    "During the 30-year period of 1900-1930, our understanding of physical laws dramatically changed.  This was partly motivated by advances in theory by Einstein's special relativity and through new experimental results (e.g., Michelson-Morley experiment).  Another great advance began in 1900 when Max Planck introduced his explanation of blackbody radiation.  The discovery of the x-ray, electron, and electron charge were also great experimental achievements.\n",

    "## Discovery of the X-Ray and the Electron\n",
    "in the 1890s, *cathode rays* were easily generated from a metal plate with a large electric potential and in an evacuated tube.  However, the origin and constitution of cathode rays was not well understood (or even known).  The concept of an atomic substructure of matter was useful to explain the results of chemical experiments, Therefore, physicists deduced that cathode rays had something to do with atoms.  For example, cathode rays could penetrate matter, and their properties were of great interest in the 1890s.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1895, Wilhelm R&ouml;ntgen studied how cathode rays interacted with various materials and noticed a phosphorescent screen glowing vividly in the darkened room.  R&ouml;ntgen realized he was observing a new kind of ray that was unaffected by magnetic fields and could better penetrate matter as compared to typical cathode rays.  He called them **x-rays**, where they were apparently produced by the cathode rays bombarding the glass walls of his vacuum tube.  R&ouml;ntgen even showed that he could obtain an image of the bones in a hand when x-rays were allowed to pass through.  For his discovery, R&ouml;ntgen received the first Nobel Prize for Physics in 1901.  See the YouTube video below from TedEd for more details.\n",

    "For several years, before the discovery of x-rays, J.J. Thomson had been studying the properties of electrical discharges in gases.  Thomson, R&ouml;ntgen and many other scientists used a similar [apparatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube) (see Figure {numref}`<number><Thomson-fig>`).  Thomson believed that cathode rays were particles, whereas several other scientists believed they were wave phenomena.\n",

    " (a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube, invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the cathode ray.

    "Thomson showed in 1897 that the charged particles emitted from a heated electrical cathode were in fact the same as cathode rays.  The rays from the cathode are attracted to the positive potential on the anode and further collimated to travel in a straight line, striking a fluorescent screen in the rear of the tube.  A voltage across the deflection plates sets up an electric field that deflects charged particles.  Thomson also studied the effects of a magnetic field upon the cathode rays and proved convincingly that the cathode rays acted as negatively charged particles (electrons) in both electric and magnetic fields.  Thomson received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1906.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Hertz performed a similar experiment, but observed on effect on the cathode rays due to the deflecting voltage.  In Hertz's experiment, the poorer vacuum allowed the cathode rays to interact with and ionize residual gas.  Thomson found the same result at first, but improved the vacuum to obtain his final result.\n",

    "## Line Spectra\n",
    "Thermal bodies produce a smooth, continuous radiation spectrum (intensity vs. wavelength), where chemical elements produce unique wavelengths (or colors) when burned in a flame or excited in an electrical discharge.  Scientists used prisms (at least since Newton) to break light apart into their constituent colors for examination.  [Henry Rowland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Augustus_Rowland) made high quality diffraction gratings, which made [optical spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_spectrometer) an important area of experimental physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Rowland was one of the first six professors chosen in 1875 for the founding of Johns Hopkins University and was one of the foremost American physicists during that time, together with Michelson.  Rowland was the first president of the [American Physical Society](https://www.aps.org/) in 1899, where Michelson was the vice president.  **Neither Rowland nor Michelson had formally earned a Ph.D. degree.**\n",

    "A spectrometer (see Fig. {numref}`{number}<spectrometer-fig>`) uses the light produced by a low-pressure gas contained in a tube, when an electrical discharge excites the atoms in the gas.  The collimated light passes through a diffraction grating (with many ruling lines per centimeter) and the diffracted light is separated at an angle $\\theta$ depending on its wavelength $\\lambda$.  The diffraction maxima are described mathematically by\n",

    "[Robert Bunsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bunsen) and [Gustav Kirchhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff) realized that the wavelength of these line spectra constituted a fingerprint for the  chemical elements and the identification for the composition of materials.  The field of spectroscopy flourished due to the continual improvements made to diffraction gratings (i.e., finer and more evenly ruled gratings).  Particular attention was paid to the Sun's spectrum in hopes of understanding the origin of sunlight.  The element helium was actually \"discovered\" by its line spectra from the Sun before it was recognized on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists of the 1800s attempted to find some simple underlying order for the characteristic wavelengths of line spectra (i.e., why are the lines different for each element?).  Hydrogen appeared to have the simplest looking spectrum and some chemists thought hydrogen atoms might build up to make more complex atoms.  [Johann Balmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Jakob_Balmer) in 1885 succeeded in obtaining a simple empirical formula that fit the wavelengths of the (then known) four lines in the hydrogen spectrum and several ultraviolet (UV) lines that were found in the spectra of white stars.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "When a formula is derived empirically, it is typically based on *measurements* of a few fundamental parameters.  The coefficient(s) of the formula denote an approximation of some other unknown (perhaps fundamental) quantities.  This is not to be confused with analytical formula, which is *derived from first principles* and expressed solely in terms of well-known fundamental quantities.\n",

    "When matter is heated, it emits radiation.  This is nothing new if you've been around a campfire or forge.  We can feel heat radiation emitted by the heat element on a electric stove, and the color of the element changes from dark red $(550^\\circ{\\rm C})$ to bright red $(700^\\circ{\\rm C})$.  If the temperature were increased further, the color would progress through orange, yellow, and finally white.  Physicists of the 19th century measured the intensity of the emitted radiation as a function of material, temperature, and wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "All bodies emit and absorb radiation.  The body is in *thermal equilibrium* with its surroundings when a its temperature is constant in time.  For this to occur, the rate of emitted radiation must equal the rate absorbed.  This implies a good thermal emitter is also a good absorber.  The simplest (or most idealized) case is called a [blackbody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body), which absorbs all the radiation falling onto it and reflects none.  The simplest way to construct a blackbody is to drill a small hole in a hollow container (or cavity), where radiation enters and is eventually absorbed after many reflections (see Fig. {numref}`{number}<cavity-fig>`).  Only a small fraction of the entering rays will exit through the hole.  If the blackbody is in thermal equilibrium, then it must also be an excellent emitter of radiation.\n",

    "Attempts to understand and derive (from basic principles) the shape of the blackbody spectral distribution (Fig. {numref}`{number}<spectrum-fig>`) were unsuccessful and presented a serious problem for scientists near the beginning of the 20th century.

Some of the electrons travel toward the **collector** (i.e., the **anode**), where either negative (*retarding*) or positive (*accelerating*) applied voltage $V$ is imposed by the power supply.  The current $I$ measured in the ammeter (photocurrent) arises from the flow of photoelectons from emitter to collector.

    "### Einstein's theory\n",
    "[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) was intrigued by Planck's hypothesis that the electromagnetic radiation field must be absorbed and emitted in *quantized* amounts.  Einstein took Planck's idea one step further and suggested that the *electromagnetic radiation field itself is quantized*.  He also suggested in his 1905 paper ([in German](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/andp.19053220607); [in English](http://astro1.panet.utoledo.edu/~ljc/PE_eng.pdf)) that \n",

To leave the material, the struck electron must give up an amount of energy $\\phi$ to overcome its binding in the material.

    "### Quantum Interpretation\n",
    "{ref}`classical` interpreted the experimental results using classical physics, but does the photoelectric effect (as explained by Einstein) explain all the data?  The 1st and 2nd experimental results can be explained, where an electron's kinetic energy does not depend on the light intensity at all.  It depends only on the light frequency and the work function of the material through\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: photoelectric_work\n",
    "\\frac{1}{2}mv^2_{\\rm max} = eV_o = hf - \\phi.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential that is slightly more positive than $-V_o$ will not be able to repel all the electrons, and practically all the electrons will be collected when the retarding voltage is near zero.  For very large positive potentials, all the electrons will be collected.  If the light intensity increases, there will be more photons per unit area, more electrons ejected, and therefore, a higher photocurrent.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a different light frequency is used, then a different stopping potential is required to stop the most energetic electrons.  For a constant light intensity, a different stopping potential $V_o$ is required for each $f$, but the maximum photocurrent will not change because the number of photoelectrons ejected is constant.  The quantum theory easily explains result 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation {eq}`photoelectric_work` predicts that the stopping potential will be linearly proportional to the light frequency, with a slope $h/e$ and $h$ *is Planck's constant*.  The slope is independent of the metal used to construct the photocathode, where Eqn. {eq}`photoelectric_work` can be rewritten as\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: stopping_V\n",
    "eV_o = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2_{\\rm max} = hf - hf_o = h\\Delta f,\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and the negative of the $y$-intercept is $\\phi = hf_o$.  The frequency $f_o$ represents the *threshold frequency* for the photoelectric effect.  This explains experimental result 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data available in 1905 were not sufficiently accurate enough to prove (or disprove) Einstein's theory, where Planck and others viewed the theory with skepticism.  in 1916, Millikan confirmed Einstein's prediction even though he set out to disprove it at the beginning of his investigation.  Millikan found the value of $h$ from the slope of a line for measurements of the kinetic energy and the photon frequency (see data in [Table III](http://hermes.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Millikan_1916_2.pdf)).  Millikan's result is in good agreement with the modern value of $h$ (see python code below).  Due to the success of these explanations and predictions, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1922."

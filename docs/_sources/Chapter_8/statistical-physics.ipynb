    "## Historical Overview\n",
    "At the beginning of the 19th century, many scientists had a mechanistic view of the universe containing a well-regulated and wholly deterministic set of physical laws.  This was in large part due to the success of Newtonian physics up to that point.  New mathematical models from Lagrange (~1790) and Hamilton (~1840) added to the computational power of Newtonian mechanics, which enabled physicists to describe complex physical systems with 2nd order differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pierre-Simon de Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace) held that it should be possible (in principle) to have a perfect knowledge of the physical universe.  This knowledge was dependent on the precision of measuring the position and velocity of every particle of matter and applying Newton's laws.  The Heisenberg uncertainty principle creates serious problems for this position.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Laplace did make major contributions to probability theory despite having a firm belief in a completely deterministic universe.  His study of probability may have been inspired to test the practical limits of measurement in classical mechanics.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of *statistical physics* in the 19th century was in tandem with the development of thermodynamics.  At this time, the *calorie* was considered a fluid that could flow through bodies to effect changes in temperature.  In 1798, [Benjamin Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Thompson) suggested that *heat* is merely the motion of individual particles in a substance.  He was ahead of his time in this idea and in the way of demonstrating it.  In 1822, [Joseph Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier) published his theory of heat, which was the first truly mathematical treatise on the subject.  It was a non-statistical, quantitative basis for later work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of energy is central to modern thermodynamics, where [James Prescott Joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule) demonstrated the mechanical equivlalent of heat in 1843.  He showed that the energy of a falling weight to turn a paddle wheel through water would transfer into the water itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "[James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell) brought the mathematical theories of probability and statistics to bear on thermodynamics.  Maxwell derived expressions for the distribution of velocities in an ideal gas and used these distributions to derive the observed macroscopic phenomena.  In thermodynamics, he believed that all relevant properties were due to the motions of individual particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 20th century, Einstein published his theory of Brownian (random) motion, which helped support the atomic view of matter.  [Jean Baptiste Perrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Perrin) would confirm Einstein's results through his experiments.  Soon after, Bohr developed his atomic model, which led to the development of quantum theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people have difficulty accepting the probablistic nature of statistical physics, where they perceive a lack of determinism.  No less a figure than Einstein worried about this.  He said, \"God does not play dice,\" which implied that some causal mechanism (beyond our understanding) must be at work.  Statistical physics is necessary regardless of the ultimate nature of reality.  This is true for *at least* three reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The problem of determining the outcome of a coint toss is so complex that it is most often useful to reduce it to statistical terms.  It depends on air resistance, rotational dynamics, and restitution that make predicting the outcome a formidable mechanics problem.\n",
    "2. When the number of pariticles is large (e.g., Avogadro's number large), it is highly impractical to study individual particles if only a description of the overall behavior is desired (e.g., pressure, temperature, or specific of an ideal gas).\n",
    "3. Uncertainties are inherent in physics, and they are significant enough to affect atomic and subatomic systems."

    "## Maxwell Velocity Distribution\n",

    "To know everything about an ideal gas, we need to describe the **state** of the gas at a given time.  This state can be defined using *six* parameters per particle consisting of three for position $(x,\\ y,\\ z)$ and three for velocity $(v_x,\\ v_y,\\ v_z)$.  Many relevant quantitities must depend on one (or more) of these six parameters.  These parameters are also described as the componenets of a 6-D **phase space**.\n",
